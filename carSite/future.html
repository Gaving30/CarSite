				BMW is preparing plug-in electric vehicles and hybrids as dedicated models like the i3 and i8, and as alternative powertrain versions of its mainstream cars. 						Ian Robertson, BMW's sales and marketing board director, predicts the i3's range extender engine option will be popular. "It's a comparatively inexpensive option and I think the take will be high," he tells Motor Trend. "Plug-in hybrid will be 15 percent, or more, of the premium segment in 10 years."The range 						extender consists of a small two-cylinder engine. It doesn't drive the wheels and doesn't add to performance, a contrast to the combustion engine in the i8, 						which is geared to the wheels. The i8 can use all its power only when the engine is running.

				GM Korea introduced the Chevrolet Miray Concept at the 2011 Seoul Motor Show. The roadster celebrates Chevrolet's 100-year heritage of designing stunning 						vehicles in the brand's newest market. According to GM Korea President and CEO Mike Arcamone, "'Miray' is Korean for 'future.' As GM rolls out Chevrolet across Korea, the Miray concept offers an exploration of future possibilities for the brand. It strengthens the bond between car and driver, creating a fresh look at 						what sports cars of the future might be." The Chevrolet Miray Concept was developed at the GM Advanced Design Studio in Seoul. Combining cutting-edge hybrid 						powertrain technology and advanced styling, it balances iconic Chevrolet design cues with a future design vision as Chevrolet celebrates its centennial in 2011.

				The hybrid system provides energy recovery, the ability to use all-wheel drive on demand, and can be used for continuously variable torque vectoring of the front axle. The e-tron has a nearly 50:50 weight distribution with almost all the weight located between the two axles. Not only does the hybrid system provide energy recovery and the ability to use all-wheel drive on demand, using two separate motors, one for each 						front wheel, means it can be used for continuously variable torque vectoring of the front axle. Being able to push the power around from side to side has 						allowed car builders to achieve new feats of handling. Audi claims that with an electronic torque vectoring system, the owner could essentially program the car 				to behave however they desire.
